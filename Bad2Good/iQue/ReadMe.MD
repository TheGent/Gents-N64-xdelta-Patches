Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Please check the ReadMe in that section for further information.

Also please make sure you use a GoodN64 scanned collection to avoid miss matches.

These tools will scan and rename your collection into "Known Good Roms" to use with my patches. If they are Prototypes, Unreleased games and unknowm to GoodN64, I will make sure the correct names and format are displayed for correct use!
