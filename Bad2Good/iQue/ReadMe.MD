# iQue Bad2Good Patches & Bad2Good Region Converts.

Here are Patches for use with [xdelta](http://xdelta.org/) command-line tool and for ease of use [xdeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) The Windows FrontEnd.

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Please check the ReadMe in that section for further information.

Also please make sure you use a GoodN64 scanned collection to avoid miss matches.

[GoodN64 2.02a](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodn64-2-02a.12068/), [GoodGUI v0.97 or GoodGUIv1.4](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodgui-v0-97.29155/) a Front end to use with GoodN64 and [bin.zip](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/bin-zip.12070/) are to be extracted to a subfolder /bin of your GoodN64 folder. Also availble is [GoodGUI GoodN64 Interactive Tutorial](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodgui-goodn64-tutorial.28965/) if needed.

These tools will scan and rename your collection into "Known Good Roms" to use with my patches. If they are Prototypes, Unreleased games and unknowm to GoodN64, I will make sure the correct names and format are displayed for correct use!

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Below are a list of the games correct names and format extention to be used with this package:


---------------------------------

iQue Patched for Emulator and FlashCart use

-----

The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (CHN).z64 - The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (CHN) [SaveFix].z64

The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (CHN).z64 - The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (CHN) (PAL) [SaveFix].z64

// This restores the saving function to the game. A really big thank you to both nekokabu & Parasyte for their invaluable help in creating this, it would not have been possible without them.

Paper Mario (CHN).z64 - Paper Mario (CHN) [f1].z64

Paper Mario (CHN).z64 - Paper Mario (CHN) (PAL) [f1].z64

Yoshi's Story (CHN).z64 - Yoshi's Story (CHN) [f1].z64

Yoshi's Story (CHN).z64 - Yoshi's Story (CHN) [f2].z64

// Yoshi's Story (CHN) [f2] is in case your version does not work with [f1]. The source file must still be named Yoshi's Story (CHN).z64 though.

The original patched version of Paper Mario (CHN) & Yoshi's Story (CHN) do not work on either Flashcart or emulator, this fixes that issue.
Enjoy!
