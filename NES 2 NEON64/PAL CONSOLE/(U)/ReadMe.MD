# PAL-(U)-NES-NEON64 Converted Patches for the PAL N64 Console.

Here are Patches for use with [xdelta](http://xdelta.org/) command-line tool and for ease of use [xdeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) The Windows FrontEnd.

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Please check the ReadMe in that section for further information.

Note: If anyone is experiencing issues with my patches and the newer versions of the Retro Stage's [N64 Blaster 2.0](https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0) because of the Automatic CIC, Region, I advise either using the [old version with the dip switches](https://web.archive.org/web/20210622192800/https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0)  or using Benn Venns excellent [JoeyN64 cart flasher](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/joeyn64-cart-flasher) and clone flashing method.


All of these patches are to be used with CIC-NUS-7101 (PAL) SRAM and any clone cart within that section can be used:

Visit the [Gent's Joey64 Clone Cart - CIC & Save Type Guide](https://github.com/TheGent/Gents-N64-xdelta-Patches/blob/main/Gent's%20Joey64%20Clone%20Cart%20-%20CIC%20%26%20Save%20Type%20Guide.md) and search for (Ctrl+F) CIC-NUS-6102 (NTSC) / CIC-NUS-7101 (PAL) SRAM


Below are a list of the games correct names and format extension to be used with this package:

If the game also has a / AKA Name, rename the file to the first listed one!
