# NTSC-CONSOLE-NES2NEON64 Patches.

Here are Patches for use with [xdelta](http://xdelta.org/) command-line tool and for ease of use [xdeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) The Windows FrontEnd.

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Please check the ReadMe in that section for further information.

Also please make sure you use a GoodN64 scanned collection to avoid miss matches.


These patches are for NES Games Converted to N64 format for users to enjoy!

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Note: If anyone is experiencing issues with my patches and the newer versions of the Retro Stage's [N64 Blaster 2.0](https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0) because of the Automatic CIC, Region, I advise either using the [old version with the dip switches](https://web.archive.org/web/20210622192800/https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0)  or using Benn Venns excellent [JoeyN64 cart flasher](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/joeyn64-cart-flasher) and clone flashing method.


Please also be advised that if you intend to use games with FlashRam saves, the N64 Blaster really is not suitable for this as it has no FlashRam support. Instead i advise using another product that does like the Benn Venns excellent [JoeyN64 cart flasher](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/joeyn64-cart-flasher).

All of these patches are to be used with CIC-NUS-6102 (NTSC) SRAM and any clone cart within that section can be used:

Visit the [Gent's Joey64 Clone Cart - CIC & Save Type Guide](https://github.com/TheGent/Gents-N64-xdelta-Patches/blob/main/Gent's%20Joey64%20Clone%20Cart%20-%20CIC%20%26%20Save%20Type%20Guide.md) and search for (Ctrl+F) CIC-NUS-6102 (NTSC) / CIC-NUS-7101 (PAL) SRAM


Please select your desired Section and make sure to read the README's for how to use.
