# USA-NTSC Patches.

Here are Patches for use with [xdelta](http://xdelta.org/) command-line tool and for ease of use [xdeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) The Windows FrontEnd.

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Please check the ReadMe in that section for further information.

Also please make sure you use a GoodN64 scanned collection to avoid miss matches.

[GoodN64 2.02a](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodn64-2-02a.12068/), [GoodGUI v0.97 or GoodGUIv1.4](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodgui-v0-97.29155/) a Front end to use with GoodN64 and [bin.zip](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/bin-zip.12070/) are to be extracted to a subfolder /bin of your GoodN64 folder. Also availble is [GoodGUI GoodN64 Interactive Tutorial](https://www.emutalk.net/threads/goodgui-goodn64-tutorial.28965/) if needed.

These tools will scan and rename your collection into "Known Good Roms" to use with my patches. If they are Prototypes, Unreleased games and unknowm to GoodN64, I will make sure the correct names and format are displayed for correct use!

Make sure your Games are the correct name and file type before patching!

Note: If anyone is experiencing issues with my patches and the newer versions of the Retro Stage's [N64 Blaster 2.0](https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0) because of the Automatic CIC, Region, I advise either using the [old version with the dip switches](https://web.archive.org/web/20210622192800/https://retrostage.net/?product=n64-blaster-2-0)  or using Benn Venns excellent [JoeyN64 cart flasher](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/joeyn64-cart-flasher) and clone flashing method.

Please also be advised that if you intend to use games with FlashRam saves, the N64 Blaster really is not suitable for this as it has no FlashRam support. Instead i advise using another product that does like the Benn Venns excellent [JoeyN64 cart flasher](https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/products/joeyn64-cart-flasher).

Below are a list of the games correct names and format extention to be used with this package:
